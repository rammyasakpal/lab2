IP Address Analyzer
This focuses on analyzing IPv4 CIDR blocks, calculating network details, and checking IP address membershipâ€”key and networking fundamentals.

Project Summary
This tool:
- Parses a given CIDR block
- Outputs the network address, broadcast address, subnet mask, and number of usable hosts
- Optionally, checks whether a given IP address belongs to the CIDR block

Build Instructions
To build the binary:
bash: go build -o bin/ipanalyzer src/ipanalyzer.go
